# BVSampler

Efficient Sampling of Bitvector Solutions for Testing (credit to QuickSampler)

This is a Python reimplementation of [QuickSampler](https://github.com/RafaelTupynamba/quicksampler/)
that works on bitvector constraints instead of propositional SAT problems.

Requirements

- Python 2.7
- Z3 + Python binding
